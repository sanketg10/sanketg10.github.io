This is 2023 - a land of ChatGPT and generative AI where machines write our code, poems and more. It seems like there is something new coming up every other month. New technlogies arrive always promising us that they will take us to "promised" land. I've had the privilege to see many such technologies arrive, some making a bigger impact than others. Right now, I am interested in everything machine learning - from the ethics, to datasets, to compute to models to product impact. 

I'm starting a personal blog today. There is no dearth of content out there, but I hope that this blog can cut through the noise and provide useful content. I'll not be limited to high level thoughts though. This will also have deep technical dives on various topics such as MLOps best practices, TensorFlow guides, deep learning architectures and more. 

Thanks for visiting. Onwards and better!

Sanket
